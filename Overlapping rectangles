Q : Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping. 
    (L1 and R1 are the extreme points of the first rectangle and L2 and R2 are the extreme points of the second rectangle).
ANS :
      class Solution {
          int doOverlap(int L1[], int R1[], int L2[], int R2[]) {
              return !(L2[0] > R1[0] || L1[0] > R2[0] || R2[1] > L1[1] || R1[1] > L2[1])
               ? 1 : 0;
          }
      };
